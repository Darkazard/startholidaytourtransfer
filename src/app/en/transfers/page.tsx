Outlet is a beautiful word for every shopaholic. 😁 Every shopaholic knows that Deepo is the largest outlet shopping center in Antalya. But maybe not everyone knows that a few years ago, a large shopping center, Mall of Antalya, was added. Now it's 2 in 1, both discount and new collections in one place🤩
⠀
Shopping enthusiasts who vacation in Belek and Kundu regions are the luckiest – for them, the travel time is 20-30 minutes. From Kemer and Side, it takes longer: 1 hour -1.15.
⠀
And even luckier are the sweet tooths who made it here 😍 Because here are the coolest candy stores that make Turkish honey pastry "Afyon Lokum Atölyesi" and delicious baklava "Güllüoğlu" @farukgulluoglu. There are separate posts about these topics with details if you missed them 😉

Friends, do you know where to go in Antalya? I'll show you three of the most interesting places in the old town. Save for the future, it will be useful!!
__________
👍🇹🇷☀
1. Hidden Park
A small green area hidden in Kaleici – offers a great view of the entire city center and especially the harbor. The area is surrounded by green spaces, recreation areas, small fountains, and various wooden sculptures that decorate the park.
2. Panoramic Elevator
This elevator provides convenient access from the main street level to the harbor in the old town. The view from the balcony offers a breathtaking panoramic view of all of Kaleici, the sea, and the Gulf of Antalya.
3. Mermerli Beach
The only place to swim in Kaleici. It's part of a restaurant of the same name and can only be reached through the restaurant. Beach entry is paid. Great view, restaurant service, comfortable, clean beach with crystal clear water.
